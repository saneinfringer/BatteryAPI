## Lessons Learned

Event Listening Optimization:
Debouncing or throttling event listeners can significantly reduce unnecessary function calls and improve performance when handling frequent battery level changes.
Removing event listeners when no longer needed conserves resources, especially for applications that only require battery information temporarily.
Data Structure Selection:
Utilizing efficient data structures like arrays or typed arrays (e.g., Float32Array) is crucial for storing and retrieving battery data (e.g., historical level information) with speed and memory optimization.
Power-Saving UI Practices:
Minimizing DOM manipulations and employing techniques like requestAnimationFrame or virtual DOM libraries (e.g., React, Vue) help minimize browser reflows and enhance UI rendering efficiency.
Exploring lighter UI representations, such as CSS animations or SVGs, can further reduce rendering overhead compared to complex HTML elements.
Browser-Specific Optimization:
For Android apps, leveraging the WorkManager API can ensure efficient scheduling of asynchronous tasks related to battery data, potentially improving battery life.
Testing and Profiling:
Thorough testing under various battery levels (full charge, critically low) is essential to identify and address potential performance issues or unexpected behavior.
Utilizing browser developer tools for profiling helps pinpoint performance bottlenecks in your code, allowing you to focus optimization efforts on the most impactful areas.


## Optimizations

User Experience:

Intuitive Interface: Design a clean and user-friendly interface with easy-to-understand controls. Consider user testing to identify and address any usability issues.
